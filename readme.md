Bumbler :bee:
The next level wrapper for bundler
======

**WOW, a bundler that suits me perfectly. - B.B. King**

Installation
```sh
git clone git@github.com:JakeCataford/bumbler
cp ./bumble /usr/local/bin # or somewhere you like to put PATHY things
```

Beng beng, now you can `bumble` instead of `bundle`.
